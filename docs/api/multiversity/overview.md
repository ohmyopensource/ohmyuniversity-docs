## What is Multiversity?

**Multiversity S.p.A.** is the leading private group in digital higher education in Italy, founded in 2006 with the launch of Università Telematica Pegaso. Backed by the British investment fund **CVC Capital Partners**, the group has grown to become one of the most significant players in the Italian e-learning landscape.

The group owns and operates three **MUR-accredited telematic universities** (università telematiche), alongside a set of non-university education and certification businesses. All academic institutions in the group share a common digital infrastructure and LMS platform, developed and maintained internally by Multiversity.

Key figures (as of 2022–2024):

- **3** accredited telematic universities
- **100+** exam locations across Italy
- **~1,000** E-Learning Center Points (ECPs) nationwide
- **110,000+** enrolled students across the group
- **40+** degree programmes, **109+** higher education courses

**Website:** [multiversity.it](https://multiversity.it)

## The Multiversity Platform

All universities in the group share a unified **LMS (Learning Management System)** platform, accessible via the `*.multiversity.click` domain. The platform provides:

- **Video lectures** - on-demand course content streamed through the student area
- **Exam booking** - online reservation of exam sessions at physical or remote locations
- **Career management** - student record, grades, and academic progress tracking
- **Administrative services** - enrollment, tuition payments, document requests
- **Accessible version** - a dedicated accessibility-compliant interface for each university

Each university instance is served at a dedicated subdomain following this pattern:

```
LMS Portal:   https://lms.{university}.multiversity.click/
Student area: https://{university}.multiversity.click/
```

::: warning
Multiversity does not currently publish a public REST API specification. The API surface documented in this section is based on observed platform behaviour and community research. Always verify against official documentation if available.
