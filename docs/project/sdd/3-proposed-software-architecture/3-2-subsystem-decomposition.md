# OhMyUniversity! - SDD: 3.2 Subsystem Decomposition

## Architectural Approach and Heuristics

The OhMyUniversity! system has been decomposed into subsystems following a layered architecture based on the Multi-layer / 3-tier pattern. The architecture is logically divided into Presentation, Application Logic, Caching & Database, and External Services layers.

The primary engineering goal of this decomposition is to manage system complexity by ensuring **high cohesion** and **low coupling** among modules.

- **High Cohesion:** Elements within the same subsystem are strongly related and collaborate towards a common, specific purpose. For instance, functionalities related to the academic career, exams, and degree planning have been grouped into a single highly cohesive subsystem.
- **Low Coupling:** Subsystems are designed to be as independent as possible, minimizing the dependencies and interactions across module boundaries. To achieve this, the architecture introduces a **Main API Gateway** within the application logic: the client applications do not need to know the specific addresses of the internal services, as the Gateway acts as a single entry point and routes the requests.

Furthermore, we applied key software engineering heuristics, such as grouping by use cases and actor responsibilities. For instance, we separated the `Portal & Social Service` (dedicated to student interactions and university news) from the `Partner Convention Service` (dedicated to corporate partners and job offers). Finally, to avoid a direct, strongly coupled access to third-party APIs (like CINECA, Esse3, or Moodle), an `External Integration Gateway` acts as an external proxy.
