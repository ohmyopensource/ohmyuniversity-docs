# OhMyUniversity! - RAD: 3.3.3 Performance

The performance requirements define the expected speed and resource efficiency of **OhMyUniversity!** during normal usage. Since the system is designed for frequent access from mobile and web devices, it must provide fast response times while limiting the consumption of device resources.

- **Response Time (Latency):** The loading of the university student record via the Cineca API must be completed within a maximum time of 2.0 seconds in 95% of requests made under 4G/5G connectivity.

- **Resource Efficiency:** The application must not consume more than 2% battery per hour of continuous active use on mid-range mobile devices from the last 3 years.
